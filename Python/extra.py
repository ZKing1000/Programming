#example:

#new amount: ?
#50% increase
#140/2 = 70
#210/3 = 70
#so:
#210/3.5 = 60
#120/60 = 2
#210/60 = 3.5 #.5 because its 75% as apposed to 50%
#400 / 100/25 = 100 and 100 + 400 = 500 #500 / (4 + 1) = 100
#140 / 100/50 = 70 and 70 + 140 = 210 #210/ (2 + 1) = 70
#325 / 100/75 = 243.75 and 325 + 243.75 = 568.75 #568.75 / (1.3333 + 1) = 243.75
