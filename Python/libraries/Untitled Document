The movie 12 Years A Slave is about a man named Solomon Northup, who was a free man until his kidnapping. This movie shows his life from here to when he’s rescued twelve years later.

    One thing I found interesting about this movie is that it’s capable of maintaining a fairly slow pace, throughout large periods of time, but still keeping me interested. Time flow was well done and no time was wasted on one particular point in the period of time this movie takes place in. Beatings are a common occurrence in this movie; somehow I find them to be very thought provoking, because of how wrong they are, and it seems that they add something to the overall quality of the movie.

    Overall I give this movie a 9 only because 10 is reserved for movies that affected me personally in a very powerful way… 12 Years A Slav
