The cache directory is for the function terrain() located in lib/saves.py. When reading some terrain located in saved/terrain/structure the interpreter may encounter something like this: material(6). This means the same material is repeated 6 times in a row. Instead of blitting the same thing 6 times, the 6 images are combined into one. This way of doings things helps condense things. It's primarily intended for the collision detection system and really efficiency in general. This directory is reset when game is quit.
