Run main.py to start the program- requires pygame and works with both Python
2.7 as well as 3.2 (usually).

Use END to access the menus, the arrow keys to move the character, and press
Enter to talk with NPCs or examine objects. For now, the E key will allow the
PC to 'attack' when not indoors, though this action doesn't currently have a
use within the game (just for fun). It will likely be removed sooner or later,
unless I decide to use it for something.

There's a ZIP/EXE Windows distributable located at:
http://www.megaupload.com/?d=X35SLYLB

The distributable contains all of the files needed to run the game on Windows
(from main.exe) if you don't have the required modules/python version. This is
typically an older version than the current code available, so running from
main.py will generally be the safest bet in accessing the game.

Program: v.062
Dist(ZIP): v.062 (just updated)
