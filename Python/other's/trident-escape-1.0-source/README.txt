Dependencies
============

You might need to install some of these before running the game:

Story
=====

There's a girl, with a fork, in a dungeon.


How To Play
===========

A young fishgirl walks around some sort of dungeon or castle or
something. Use the arrow keys to move around and the space bar to spear
enemies with your trident.

The trident will extend for as long as you keep the space bar pressed, or until
it hits a wall, enemy or other obstacle. If you hit an enemy, you can pull them
back to you and, once brought back, walk around carrying your captured foe for
as long as you keep the space bar held down. Releasing the space bar will throw
the caught enemy out ahead of you, hopefully destroying both it and any other
foes you can strike.

Different enemies have different strengths, weaknesses and behaviours - not all
will be dispatched as easily as written here. Experiment to work out how each one can be defeated.


Saving And Continuing
=====================

The game saves your progress as you play. If your character meets an unfortunate
fate in the castle, the game will return you to the start of the room you most
recently entered.

When you quit the game, your progress is retained. When you next start, you will
be able to choose to start a new game or continue from where you left off. Be
aware that you can only have one game in progress at a time - if you choose to
start anew, the old game will be lost forever!
